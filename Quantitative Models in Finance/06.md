## Utility Functions Commonly Used in Finance

### Quadratic utility function
$u(z) = z - \frac{b}{2}z^2$  
(parabola concave down)

$u'(z) = 1 -bz$  
$u'(z) = 0 \leftrightarrow z=\frac{1}{b}$

$u''(z) = -b < 0$  
maximum $= (\frac{1}{b}, \frac{1}{2b})$

There is an issue, after the maximum, the function decreases, which is in conflict with the assumption that utility functions are always increasing.

>Absolute measure of risk aversion  
>$R_A(Y) = - \frac{u''(x)}{u'(x)}$ Absolute

$R_A(z) = - \frac{u''(z)}{u'(z)} = \frac{b}{1-bz}$

$\frac{dR_A(z)}{dz} = \frac{b^2}{(1-bz)^2} > 0$

Which is an issue because it says that as someone gets richer (for higher values of z) he becomes more risk averse, which is not realistic.

### Negative exponential utility function  

$u(z) = - e^{bz}, b\geq0$

$u'(z) = be^{-bz} \geq0$

$u''(z) = -b^2e^{-bz} \leq0$

$lim z inf -e^{-bz} = 0$

$R_A(z) = - \frac{u''(z)}{u'(z)} = \frac{-b^2e^{-bz}}{be^{-bz}} = b$

The richer someone gets, after it reaches z, it is constant, hence indifferent to risk as they are getting more money.

### Logarithmic Utility Function

$u(z) = log(z)$

$u'(z) = \frac{1}{z}$

$u''(z) = \frac{1}{z^2} < 0 $

$R_A(z) = - \frac{u''(z)}{u'(z)} = \frac{-\frac{1}{z^2}}{\frac{1}{z}} = \frac{1}{z}$

Decreasing absolute risk aversion

$R_R(z) = zR_A(z) = 1$

Constant relative risk aversion

Ideal case: 

Decreasing absolute risk aversion
Constant relative risk aversion

### Isoelastic Utility Function

$$u(z) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{z^(1-\gamma)}{1-\gamma}
\end{cases}
$$
