### Canonical Portfolio Problem

- Risk averse investor
- $Y_0$ = inital wealth
- Two investment opportunities:
  - One is risky with rate of return $\widetilde{r}$ 
  - One is risky-free with rate of return $rf$ 

$a$ = amount of money invested in the risky asset  
$Y_0-a$ = amount of money invested in the risk-free asset  

The investor chooses $a$ to maximize the expected utility of the final wealth $\widetilde{Y}$.

---

If $W'(0) = 0$, tha maximum is in 0.  
This is the case in which $u$ is maximized when all the money is put in the risk free.

If $W'(0) < 0, \rightarrow \hat{a} < 0$  
Investing in the risky asset

If $W'(0) > 0, \rightarrow \hat{a} > 0$  
**Short selling the risky asset**

Short selling is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller.
It is motivated by the belief that a security's price will decline, enabling it to be bought back at a lower price.

### Short Selling Example

A trader believes that stock X which is trading at 50 will decline in price and therefore **borrows** 100 shares and sells them.

A week later the stock price X falls to 45.

The trader decides to close the position and buys 100 shares of X at 45 on the open market to replace the borrowed shares.

The traders profit is:  
$\pi_T = 100*50 - 100*45$ excluding commissions and interest

### Theorem 5.4 Arrow (1971)

Let $\hat{a} = \hat{a}(Y_0)$ (let $\hat{a}$ be a function of $Y_0$) be the solution to problem 5.1 (Canonical Portfolio Problem);  
then

>$R_A(Y) = - \frac{u''(x)}{u'(x)}$ Absolute Measure of risk Aversion

DARA *(Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion)*  
$R_A'(Y) < 0 \rightarrow \hat{a'}(Y_0) > 0$  
*This is the most reasonable in real life, the richer an individual, the less risk averse*


CARA *(Constant Absolute Risk Aversion)*  
$R_A'(Y) = 0 \rightarrow \hat{a'}(Y_0) = 0$

IARA *(Increasing Absolute Risk Aversion)*  
$R_A'(Y) > 0 \rightarrow \hat{a'}(Y_0) < 0$

### Theorem 5.5 Arrow (1971)

> $R_R(Y) = YR_A(Y) = -Y\frac{u''(x)}{u'(x)}$ Relative Measure of risk aversion


>$\eta = \eta(Y, \hat{a}) = \frac{\partial \hat{a}/\hat{a}}{\partial \hat{Y}/\hat{Y}}$  
>The wealth of elasticity of investment in the risky asset

>If $\eta > 1$, as wealth increases, the percentage increases in the amount optimally invested in the risky asset exceeding the percentage increase in $Y$.

If for all wealth levels $Y$ 

CRRA $R_R(Y') = 0 \rightarrow \eta = 1$

DRRA $R_R(Y') < 0 \rightarrow \eta > 1$

IRRA $R_R(Y') > 0 \rightarrow \eta < 1$

Arrow adds an assumption, found through 
$R_R(Y)$ is constant and it is approximately equal to 1, so the most appropriate utility function is the Isoelastic Utility Function.

>### Isoelastic Utility Function

>$$u(z) =
>\begin{cases}
>\frac{z^(1-\gamma)}{1-\gamma}, \gamma  \neq 1, \gamma > 1  \\
>log(z), \gamma = 1
>\end{cases}
>$$

>$u'(z) = \frac{1}{z}$  
>$u''(z) = - \frac{1}{z^2}$

>$R_A(z) = \frac{\gamma}{z}$ Constant absolute risk aversion

>$R_R(z) = \gamma$ Constant relative risk aversion

---

### Special case of a risk neutral investor

$u(z) = c+dz, d>0$  
$\max{a}\space E[u(\widetilde{Y})] = E[u(Y_0(1+rf + a(\widetilde{r}-rf)))] = \\
= \max{a} \space E[c+d(Y_0(1+rf)+a(\widetilde{r}-rf))] =$  

$= E[\widetilde{r}-rf] = 0$ This is the risk premium!

If the risk premium is positive (as it usually is), a risk neutral investor will invest as much as possible in the risky asset.

---

### Modern Portfolio Theory

**Has strong implications for real, everyday practitioners**

In the canonical portfolio problem we have to determine only one variable $a$:

$\max{a}\space E[u(\widetilde{Y})] = E[u(Y_0(1+rf + a(\widetilde{r}-rf)))] $

But in general we can admit $N$ risky assets, with returns $\widetilde{r_1}, \widetilde{r_2}, ..., \widetilde{r_N}$

$a_1$ = amount of money invested in asset 1 $\downarrow$  
$a_N$ = amount of money invested in asset $N$

$Y_0 - \frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}} a_i$ = amount of money to be invested in the risk free


$\max{a}\space (a_1,a_2,...,a_N)$

$\rightarrow Y_0(1+rf)+ \frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}} a_i (\widetilde{r_i}-rf)$

$\omega_i = \frac{a_i}{Y_0}$ = fraction of the initial wealth invested in asset $i$, $i=1,...,N$

---

If we consider $\omega_i$ instead of $a_i$ the problem changes:

$\max{\omega_i}\space (\omega_1,\omega_2,...,\omega_N)$  

$E[u(-)] \text{ of}$

$Y_0(1+rf)+ \frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}} \omega_i Y_0 (\widetilde{r_i}-\text{rf})$  
$\rightarrow$ doing some algebra  
$Y_0(1+\sum_{i=1}\omega_i \widetilde{r_i} + (1- \sum_{i=1}\omega_i)\text{rf})$

> $\sum_{i=1}\omega_i \widetilde{r_i} + (1- \sum_{i=1}\omega_i)rf$ is the **rate of return of the portfolio**: it is a linear combination of each asset in the market $\widetilde{r_p}$

---

Finally, this is the problem to solve in modern portfolio theory:

$\max{\omega_i}\space (\omega_1,\omega_2,...,\omega_N)$  

$E[u(Y_0(1+\widetilde{r_p}))]$

We can simplify the solution of this problem by using an utility function (that we don't like at all) the quadratic utility function (even if it shows increasing adversion to risk).
