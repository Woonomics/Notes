## Risk Premium and Certainty Equivalent

Consider an investor with current wealth Y, evaluating an uncertain risky payoff $z$ with expected value $E[\widetilde{z}]$.

The Certainty Equivalent of $\widetilde{z}$, $CE(Y, \widetilde{z})$ is the solution to:

$E[u(Y,\widetilde{z})] = u(Y+CE(Y,\widetilde{z}))$

---

$u^{-1}(E[Y+\widetilde{z}]) = u^{-1}(u(Y+CE(Y,\widetilde{z}))) = Y + CE(Y,\widetilde{z})$

MISSING PIECE  
$Y + CE(Y,\widetilde{z}) = u^{-1}(u(Y+CE(Y,\widetilde{z}))) - Y$

We computed the value through the inverse of a function
>An inverse of a function always exists when a function is monotonic

This is the sum of money that makes an investor indifferent between participating in a lottery or not.  
This is also the maximum prize that an investor can receive.

### Jensen Inequality

Let g be a concave function on the interval $(a,b)$ and $X$ a random variable such that:

$Prob[X e (a,b)]=1$ then  

$E[g(x)] \leq g(E[x])$

---

If we consider using the technique of inverting the function ($u^{-1}$):

$u^{-1}(E[Y+\widetilde{z}]) \leq u^{-1}(u(Y+E(\widetilde{z})))$

$Y + CE[Y,\widetilde{z}] \leq Y + E[\widetilde{z}]$

we can remove $Y$

$CE[Y,\widetilde{z}] \leq E[\widetilde{z}]$

hence

$E[\widetilde{z}] - CE(Y, \widetilde{z}) = \pi (Y, \widetilde{z})$ Risk Insurance Premium

Exercise number 3, done on paper

Note:

$u^{-1}(E[Y+\widetilde{z_2}]) > u^{-1}(E[Y+\widetilde{z_1}])$  
$\leftrightarrow$  
$CE[Y,\widetilde{z_2}] > CE[Y,\widetilde{z_1}]$
