## First Order Stochastic Dominance

A weaker concept of dominance with wider applicability than the concept of state by state dominance.

### Example

Consider two investment alternatives: $z_1$ and $z_2$, with the following characteristics:

| Payoffs | 10 | 100 | 2000 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $Prob[z_1]$ | 0.4| 0.6 | 0 |  
| $Prob[z_2]$ | 0.4| 0.4 | 0.2 |  

These two investments cannot be ranked using state by state dominance.  

$E[z_1] = 10*0.4 + 100*0.6 + 0 = 64$  
$Var[z_1] = E[z_1^2] - E^2[z_1] = 10^2*0.4+100^2*0.6-64^2 = 1944$

$E[z_2] = 10*0.4 + 100*0.4 + 0.2*2000 = 444$  
$Var[z_2] = E[z_2^2] - E^2[z_2] = 10^2*0.4+100^2*0.4+2000^2*0.2-444^2 = 606.904$

We cannot rank using the mean variance criteria.  
$E[z_2] > E[z_1]$  
$Var[z_2] > Var[z_1]$

FSD does not consider preferences.

Cumulative distribution function

For a given random variable $Z_k$ 

The distribution function is  
$F_k(z) = Prob[Z_k \leq z]$

In this case, $z_1$ and $z_2$ are 2 discrete random variables.

$F_k(z) = Prob[Z_k \leq z]  = \sum_{k:z_k\leq z} Prob[Z_k = z]$

$$
F_1(z) = 
\begin{cases} 
0, z<10 \\
0.4, 10 \leq z < 100 \\
1, 100\leq z 
\end{cases}
$$

$$
F_2(z) = 
\begin{cases} 
0, z<10 \\
0.4, 10 \leq z < 100 \\
0.8, 100\leq z < 2000 \\
1.0, z \geq 2000 \\

\end{cases}
$$

If we draw the graph, $F_2$ is strictly less than $F_1$, then they take the same value.

### Definition of FSD
Let $F_A(z)$ and $F_B(z)$, respectively, represent the cumulative distribution functions of two random variables that assume values in the interval $[A,B]$ we say that $F_A(z)$ first order stochastically dominates (FSD) $F_B(z)$ if and only if:

$F_A(z) \leq F_B(z) \forall z \in  [A,B]$

Proof *not needed*
### Theorem
Let $F_A(z)$ and $F_B(z)$, be cumulative distribution functions for random payoffs $z \in [A,B] $.

Then, $F_A(z) \text{ FSD } F_B(z)$ if and only if $E[u(A)] \geq E[u(B)]$ for all non-decreasing utility functions $u$.

$F_k(z) = Prob[Z_k \leq z]  = \sum_{k:z_k\leq z} Prob[Z_k = z]$

$\int_{-\inf}^z f_k(u) du$ *continuous random variable*

$E[x] = \sum_{k:z_k\leq z} x_k Prob[x=x_k]$ *discrete random variable*
