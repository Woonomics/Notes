[Arrow-Debreu Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu_model)

**Explicit Utility functions** are the ones in which the full utility is specified.

In the case of $maxU(C_1,C_2)$ its implicit.

---

The consumer chooses her consumption profile $(C_1; C_2)$, and the allocation of their
savings $S$ between bank deposits $D_h$ and securities (bonds) $B_h$, in a way that maximizes their utility function $u$ under their budget constraint:

>$\omega_h$ wealth owned by households = consumption now (time 1) $C_1$ + Deposits $D_h$ + Deposits $B_h$  
> $pC_2$ = price * consumption (time 2) = cost of future consumption (time 2) 

$$\begin{cases} 
maxU(C_1,C_2)\\
s.t.
\begin{cases}
C_1+D_h+B_h = \omega_h \\
p C_2 = \Pi_f + \Pi_b + (1 + r)B_h + (1+ r_D)D_h
\end{cases}
\end{cases}$$



To solve this issue we have to build up a lagrangian

>In mathematical optimization, the method of *Lagrange multipliers* is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equation constraints

>Lagrange multiplier Equation with 1 constraint  
>$L(x,y,λ) = f(x,y) - λg(x, y)$  
>
>Where $g(x,y) = 0$ ($g$ is just $f$ but equal to $0$, so all factors are brought to one sign and changed of sign:  
>$x+y = z$ becomes $(x+y-z)$

>Lagrange multiplier Equation with 2+ constraints  
>$L(x,y,\lambda_1, \lambda_2, ..., \lambda_n) = f(x,y) -  λ_1g_1(x, y) - λ_2g_2(x, y) - ... - λ_ng_n(x, y)$

>In this case however, the implicit value of $u(C_1,C_2)$ counts as one maximization constraint

$$L(u(C1,C2), λ) =\\
u(C_1,C_2)-\\
\lambda[(C_1+D_h +B_h- w_h)+
(p C_2 - \Pi_f - \Pi_b - (1 + r)B_h - (1+ r_D)D_h)]
$$

Now to asses local maxima and minima we can take the first *partial* derivative of each parameter, in this way we can get to know for each parameter, what satisfies the constraint (max $u(C_1,C_2)$)

Partial derivative of $C_1$, *consumption in time 1*

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial C_1} = \frac{\partial u'}{\partial C_1} - \lambda*1 = 0$

> Since $u(C_1,C_2)$ is not known, $\frac{\partial u'}{\partial C_1}$ cannot be expressed and has to remain implicit; that's just a way to say "the partial derivative of that"

Partial derivative of $C_2$, *consumption in time 2*

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial C_2} = \frac{\partial u'}{\partial C_2} - \lambda*p = 0$

Since to maximize our constraint we put both partial derivatives equal to $0$  
$\frac{\partial L}{\partial C_1}$ =  $\frac{\partial L}{\partial C_2}$ = 0

>We can say that in equilibrium, marginal utility (given by the derivates) of consumption at time 1 must be equal to marginal utility of consumption at time 2.

Furthermore:

Partial derivative of $D_h$, Debts held by households

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial D_n} = -\lambda [1- (1+r_D)] = 0$

Partial derivative of $B_h$, Bonds held by households

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial B_h} = -\lambda [1- (1+r)] = 0$

We can easily see from this system that:
$$\begin{cases}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial D_n} = -\lambda [1- (1+r_D)] = 0\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial B_h} = -\lambda [1- (1+r)] = 0
\end{cases}
\\-\lambda [1- (1+r_D)] = -\lambda [1- (1+r)] \\
r_D = r
$$

Interest rate of Deposits = Interest Rate  
If $r$ wasn't equal to $r_D$ investors would buy only bonds!
