### Resource allocation

Banks allocate resources through investments.
Market-oriented economies are not very good at dealing with non diversifiable risk.

In Italy, professor's research found that Italy's growth was stunted by not funding innovative sectors.

Italy is a net saver.

### Arrow–Debreu model

Under:

- Perfect competition
- Perfect information (complete)
- Convex preference

There must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy.

The role of banking in the Arrow–Debreu model

Only 2 sectors: Households and Firms

Households maximize their utility through savings.

---

Example economy:

Two dates: $t=1,2$

Unique physical good initially owned by consumers.

Agents are households ($h$), Firms ($f$), and banks $(b)$.

All agents behave competitively: 0 profits, no buyer or supplier power. Everyone is a price taker.

All interests rates are given for banks.

$i = f,h,b$  
$j = h,b$

$r =$ interest rate

$^+ =$ supply  
$^- =$ demand

Solve the maximization problem for $h,f,b$

$$\begin{cases} 
maxU(C_1,C_2)\\
s.t.
\begin{cases}
C_1+D_h+B_h = \omega_h \\
\rho C_2 = \Pi_f + \Pi_b + (1 + r)B_h + (1+ r_D)D_h
\end{cases}
\end{cases}$$

Solution  
$r =r_D$

If r wasn't equal to $r_D$ investors would buy only bonds!
