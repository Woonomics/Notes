**Amazon** is a special case since it did not issue dividends since 1994

>Also **Apple** didn't pay any dividends between 1996 and 2012  
>U.S. tech companies are averse to dividends

>$EPS$ = Earnings per Share  
>$Div$ = Dividends

$Div = EPS * \pi$

### Gordon - *Shapiro* formula
to compute stock price

>$P_0$ Current stock price  
>$g$ expected growth rate for dividends  
>$r$ expected cost of equity capital for the company

$P_0 = \frac{Div}{r-g}$ 

Managers are conservative: giving dividends equals giving information to the market.  
If 10$ of dividends is issued this year, next year the market expects no less than 10$.

From the 60's to 2008, the dividends of most companies stayed exactly the same.  

From Q1 2007 to Q4 2008 there was a big decrease in companies increasing their dividends, some decreasing dividends or stopping dividends altogether.

Even in an extremely bad situation such as 2008 crisis, most companies **DID NOT** reduce or stop dividends to signal robustness to the market.
