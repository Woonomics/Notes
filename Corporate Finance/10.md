From where risk comes from?

Risk can come from different sources, ranging from risk that comes from specific projects to the ones that may affect an entire industry or the entire market.

Expected return of the portfolio:

$E(R_P) = \sum_{i=1}^n (w_i - E(R_i))$

Risk can be reduced but never avoided.

Diversification Eliminates Specific Risk  - [Markoviz Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model)

>The HM model is also called mean-variance model due to the fact that it is based on expected returns (mean) and the standard deviation (variance) of the various portfolios. It is foundational to **Modern portfolio theory**.

Tobin [Separation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund_separation_theorem)

>Any investor's optimal portfolio can be constructed by holding each of certain mutual funds in appropriate ratios, where the number of mutual funds is smaller than the number of individual assets in the portfolio.

>Under mean-variance analysis, it can be shown that every minimum-variance portfolio given a particular expected return (that is, every efficient portfolio) can be formed as a combination of any two efficient portfolios. If the investor's optimal portfolio has an expected return that is between the expected returns on two efficient benchmark portfolios, then that investor's portfolio can be characterized as consisting of positive quantities of the two benchmark portfolios.
