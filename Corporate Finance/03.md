| Project | CF0 | CF1 | NPV 20% |
| --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  
| A | 42 | 42 | 42+35=77 |
| **B** | -20 | 144 | -20+120=100 |
| C | -100 | 225 | -100+225=87.5 |

NPV Suggests to choose B, how does the criteria changes with different investors preferences?

---
Whether you choose to deposit or borrow it doesn't matter as long as you maximize NPV.

### Fisher separation theorem

The primary objective of a corporation is to maximize $NPV$ regardless of shareholder preferences.

---

**DO NOT** confuse Real Markets with Capital Markets.  

In Capital Markets where (theoretically) there are no barriers to competition are (theoretically) perfectly competitive.

Through Monitoring and Incentives we can mitigate the issue of clash between shareholder's interests and managerial interests.

$NPV = -I_{0}+\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{Cashflow}{(1+K)^t}$

- Length of investment  
  - (can also be timeless, perpetuity )
- Size and type of cash flow
- Cost of capital

---

### Perpetuity 
assumption of cashflows being timeless

PV of cash flow = $\frac{cash flow}{discount-rate}$

$PV = \frac{C}{r}$

---

### Growing Perpetuity

$PV_0 = \frac{C_1}{r-g}$  
$g$ = annual growth rate of cash flow

---
Example:
- 1 Billion $ perpetuity
- rate of return $r= 10%$
- constant growth rate $g= 4%$


$PV = \frac{1}{.10 - .4} = 1.\overline{6}$ Billion $

---

PV of annuity $= C [\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r(1+r)^t}]$

Or *alternatively*  

$VA = C [ \frac{1-(1+k)^{-n}}{k} ]$

---

### Determining Bond and Stock value

**Bond** - Fixed income instrument which represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower.  

---

### Bond Issuers

- Treasury
- Municipal
- Corporate Bonds
- Foreign Bonds

---

### Bond Market Price

- Risk free rate (+)
  - Compensated by changes in expected inflation  
- Default Probability (+)
- Tax advantages (for corporate bonds) (-)
