The marginal investor bears only systemic risk.


$K_f$ No risk (positive rate of return)

$K_m$ sistemic risk.

A model to identify a rate of return: CAPM

Capital Asset Pricing Model (1964, Sharpe)
>In a competitive market, the expected risk premium varies in direct proportion to beta


$K_f$ = Risk Free return rate  
$K_m$ = Market return rate

$r_i$ = firm $i$ return rate

$E[r_i] = K_f + \beta[K_m - K_f]$

$NPV = -I_0 + \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{FCF}{(1+k)^{t}}$



>Jensen's Alpha

>Beta time window is usually 3-5 years

$R_m$ = Market risk (variance)  
$R_i$ = risk (variance) of single company $i$

$\beta_i =  \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\text{Var}(R_m)}$
