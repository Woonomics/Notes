Why do we use cash flows and not profits to evaluate companies?

Net income and dividends tend to be the same.  

Dividends tends to be preferred just because it goes into the hand of the shareholder.

>Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)

>NOPAT $\rightarrow$ Net Operating Profit After Taxes  
Is the profit that should be given in dividends.

Managers are careful not to boost NOPAT, to pay less taxes.
Sometimes (in the case of an acquisition) they would want to maximize NOPAT to show strength.

Cashflows hare hard to manipulate, the opposite of profits!

>Free cash flow from operations (FCFO)

EBIT = (net income) + interest + taxes = EBITDA – (depreciation and amortization expenses)

operating income = (gross income) – OPEX = EBIT – (non-operating profit) + (non-operating expenses)[3]

---

EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization
OPEX = operating expense

---

EBITDA should be strictly positive
It is not influenced by costs that can be subjectively estimated

EBITDA is also imporant because it gives a first signal about the firms capability to produce cash through operations

Counterexample: [Uber had negative EBITDA for years](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/UBER/uber-technologies/ebitda)

Direct and indirect method of calculating FCFFs

---

FCFU $\geq$ FCFE

FCFE = Net Income + Non cash Expenses + Net Borrowing - FC Inv - WC Inv

---

Equity Side FCFO
- $+$ taxes on operating income
- $-$ taxes on gross profit  
- $\frac{+}{-}$ var in long term debt
- $-$ interest expenses

In the case in which there is no debt, everything here is zero, since (operating income == gross profit) and long term debt and interest expenses will go to zero
