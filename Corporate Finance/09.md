Risk definition:  
"Chi non risica non rosica" :fire:  
Managers cannot avoid risk but can manage it in their decisions.

There is a positive relationship between risk and return.

**Marginal Investor**: Investors that search for short-term gains by trading stocks, assumed to hold a “diversified” portfolio

Sometimes is the main owner of the company.  

The models of risk mitigation that we are going to study in this course will be specifically **tailored for corporation**.

### Realized rate of return

$P_t$ = investment at time $t$  
$P_{t-1}$ = investment at time $t-1$  (if $t$ is day, the day before etc.)  
$\text{DIV}_t$ = dividend at time $t$  

$$K = \frac{P_t + \text{DIV}_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$$

---

### Expected Return

$$E[K] = \sum_{i=1}^N K_i p_i$$

But since the future cannot be predicted, here is expected future return

$$\bar{K} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N K_t$$

### Risk is variance
Difference between Realized Return $R_i$ - Expected return $E(R)$

$$\sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i (R_i - E(R))^2$$
