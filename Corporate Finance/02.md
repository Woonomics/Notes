Suppose you have a company.

| Assets | Liabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Machinery 1000 | Equity 1500 |
| Cash 900 | |

>Price of a share: 1$  
>The company signs a contract  
>Price of a share: 2$  
>Production doesn't meet expectations  
>Price of a share: 1$

Not your classical financial statement as here we are analyzing in terms of shareholder value.

| Assets | Liabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Machinery 1000 | Equity 1500 |
| Cash 900 | |
|---|---|
|Growth Opportunities 500 | Equity 500|

We cannot limit maximization of *value* to maximization of *shareholder value*.

Net Present Value = -Initial Investment + each discounted return

$NPV = -I_{0}+\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{Cashflow}{(1+K)^t}$

**Decision Rule**: Accept if $NPV > 0$
